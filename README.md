# Employee Manager
A simple Spring Boot back-end made with the intention to go through the basics of integrating a Spring Boot back-end with an Angular app for data persistence.
<br><br>
This back-end takes care of data persistence. It processes requests from the [Angular app](https://github.com/Helio4/employee-manager-frontend) I made, ensuring that the Employee database is up to date
with the requests the user makes from the web app.
## Video sample
Here's a video of the front-end and back-end working together:
